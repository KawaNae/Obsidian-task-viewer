import { PopoverSuggest } from 'obsidian';

/**
 * Takes the user's "back" for a surface of our own while it is open, as
 * Obsidian's modals, menus and suggestions take it: Android's back gesture
 * or button, and on the desktop the mouse's back button (`history.back()`).
 *
 * Obsidian keeps, per window, a stack of what is open over the workspace,
 * each with an `onHistoryBack`. Android's back comes to the app as
 * Capacitor's `backButton` event; Obsidian's one listener to it calls the
 * top of the stack's `onHistoryBack` when the stack has anything, and only
 * otherwise folds a sidebar, goes back in the tab's history, or offers to
 * leave the app. `history.back()` is patched to call the same top, and the
 * desktop's mouse back button calls `history.back()`. A surface outside the
 * stack gets none of these: the back folds the sidebar behind it instead.
 * (Obsidian 1.13.7's `app.js`, read on the Android emulator.)
 *
 * The stack is not published. What stands in it is opened and closed by
 * Obsidian's own classes, and the smallest of them is `PopoverSuggest`,
 * which is published: its `open` pushes the suggestion onto the stack after
 * pushing its scope and attaching its DOM, and its `close` pops it after
 * popping the scope, clearing its suggestions and detaching the DOM. Those
 * two are run here on a stand-in that has no scope to push and no DOM to
 * attach, so what is left of them is the stack. Being unpublished, this may
 * go: then nothing is pushed and the back does what it did before, the
 * surface working otherwise as ever. Every reliance on it is here.
 *
 * @param onBack what the back does while the surface is open
 * @returns what lets go of the back, once the surface closes; calling it
 *   again does nothing
